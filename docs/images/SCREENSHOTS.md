# Screenshot Capture Checklist

This file tracks every screenshot referenced by the documentation. Each guide references images by filename (e.g. `![Request editor](../images/quickstart-send-request.png)`); capture each one and drop it into this `docs/images/` folder using the exact filename listed below.

**Tips for consistent screenshots**
- Use a clean window at a comfortable zoom; crop to the relevant panel.
- Capture both light and dark only if a guide specifically calls for it (none currently require both).
- Prefer PNG. Keep widths reasonable (~1200px) so GitHub renders them well.
