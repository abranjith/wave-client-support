# Wave Client Documentation

**Wave Client** is a modern, platform‑agnostic REST API client that runs both as a **Visual Studio Code extension** and as a **standalone web app**. It helps you build, send, organize, and validate API requests — and chain them into automated flows and test suites — with the same interface everywhere.

> **Wave Client is currently in public beta.** Features are stable enough for everyday use, but some areas are still evolving. See the [Release Notes](release-notes.md).

## Start here

New to Wave Client? Follow these in order:

1. **[Installation](getting-started/installation.md)** — set up the VS Code extension or the web app.
2. **[Quick Start](getting-started/quick-start.md)** — send your first request in a couple of minutes.
3. Browse the feature guides below for anything you want to go deeper on.

> Inside either app, click the **Documentation** icon in the left sidebar to jump back here at any time.

### Getting started
- [Installation](getting-started/installation.md) — prerequisites and setup for VS Code and the web app

### Features

| Area | Guide | What it covers |

### Platform guides
- [VS Code extension](platforms/vscode.md) — command, keybinding, storage, and theme integration
- [Web app](platforms/web-app.md) — running the local server + UI, ports, and troubleshooting

### Reference
- [Design & Architecture](design.md) — how Wave Client is built (for the architecture‑curious)
- [Wave Schemas](schemas.md) — the persisted collection & environment file formats, field by field
- [Versioning](versioning.md) — the four version tracks, semver semantics, and the release bump checklists
- [Build Your Own Client](build-your-own-client.md) — use the platform-agnostic core to build a new client (CLI, desktop, …)
- [Release Notes](release-notes.md) — what's in each release

## Feedback & contributing

Wave Client is in public beta — your input directly shapes what gets built next.

### Reporting bugs

[Open a bug report on GitHub](https://github.com/abranjith/wave-client-support/issues/new?template=bug_report.md). The template asks for:
- Which **feature area** is affected (Requests, Collections, Flows, etc.)
- Your **environment** (VS Code extension or web app, OS, Wave Client version)
- A HAR file attachment if the bug involves a request or flow — this is optional but very helpful

### Requesting features

[Open a feature request on GitHub](https://github.com/abranjith/wave-client-support/issues/new?template=feature_request.md). Requests for new platform clients (a CLI, a desktop app, …) are as welcome as improvements to the existing ones — Wave Client is designed to grow beyond VS Code and the web app.

Browse [existing issues](https://github.com/abranjith/wave-client-support/issues) before opening a new one. Upvoting an existing issue is the clearest signal that something matters.

### Pull requests

The project isn't accepting pull requests yet — the codebase is still evolving quickly and we want the foundations to stabilise first. This will open up soon; contribution guidelines will be added here when it does.

## Documentation conventions

- All links between docs are **relative**, so the documentation works on GitHub today and can be moved to a dedicated docs site later without rewrites.
- Each folder has a landing page; feature guides live under [features/](features/) and platform guides under [platforms/](platforms/).
- Screenshots referenced in these guides live in [images/](images/). Images still to be captured are tracked in [images/SCREENSHOTS.md](images/SCREENSHOTS.md).
- Shared topics (authentication, environments, variables) are documented once and linked from the guides that use them, rather than repeated.
- **For AI tools / LLMs:** [llms.txt](llms.txt) is a curated, machine-readable map of this documentation (per the [llms.txt convention](https://llmstxt.org)), and [llms-full.txt](llms-full.txt) is every page concatenated into one file for direct ingestion.

## What is Wave Client, in one minute?

- **One core, many clients.** The same platform-agnostic core runs in a VS Code webview and in the browser today, thanks to an [adapter architecture](design.md) — and new clients (a CLI and beyond) can be [built on the same core](build-your-own-client.md).
- **Requests beyond HTTP.** Send classic HTTP requests, or open long‑lived **WebSocket** and **Server‑Sent Events (SSE)** connections.
- **Organize and reuse.** Group requests into [collections](features/collections.md), parameterize them with [environments](features/environments.md) and [variables](features/variables.md), and store reusable [credentials](features/wave-store.md).
- **Automate.** Chain requests into [flows](features/flows.md) and build [test suites](features/tests.md), then export [run reports](features/reporting.md).
- **AI built in.** Ask [Wave Arena](features/ai-arena.md) about web standards or your own workspace.

For a tour of capabilities, see the [Release Notes](release-notes.md). For the "why" behind the design, see [Design & Architecture](design.md).
