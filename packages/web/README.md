The Wave Client **web app** — runs the shared Wave Client UI in the browser.

## Purpose

This package delivers Wave Client as a standalone browser application. It reuses the platform‑agnostic UI from [`@wave-client/core`](../core/README.md) and bridges it to a local backend ([`@wave-client/server`](../server/README.md)) through a web platform adapter, so the browser app has the same capabilities as the VS Code extension.

## Responsibilities

- The **browser entry point** and app shell (theme, layout, server‑connection monitoring).
- The **web adapter** (`webAdapter`): implements `IPlatformAdapter` by delegating I/O to the server over HTTP, and wires server push events (including realtime WS/SSE updates) into the UI over a WebSocket channel.
